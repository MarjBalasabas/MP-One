                                                Men need encouragement, Godly wisdom, and hope today more than ever. While the world tends to tell men to hide their emotions and act tough, God's Word is filled with men who passionately and whole-heartedly sought God with their heart, mind, and soul! God has a special calling for men to be strong, courageous leaders, and His Scripture can provide the inspiration you need to take daily steps towards your calling.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                It may not seem obvious, but men need encouragement. Men may try to look all tough, like they can handle any situation that life throws at us. But honestly, men need some reassuring words just like everyone else.
                                                The Bible is not only full of encouraging verses. It also outlines the roles of men. For instance, Adam was placed in the garden of Eden to work. Joshua was a man who leads his family to worship the Lord. Paul stresses that every man should love their wife just as Jesus loves the church. And that they should provide for their families.
                                                <br><br>
                                                Prayer: Lord, I dedicate this man that comes seeking encouragement from you. That you may renew his strength and lead him in your paths of righteousness. Amen.

                                                    Without women in our lives, the world just wouldn’t be the same. Jesus was brought into the world by a strong woman and, even at the beginning of humanit,y God put a woman on Earth to accompany man. There are many Bible verses about women that show their strength time and time again during hardship, life’s most fearful moments, and in happy times, too.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    God made women in his image for a special reason, and the word of the Lord reminds us of this fact each and every day through specific verses and stories passed down of powerful women such as Mary, Rachel, Rebecca, Ruth, and more. These leaders, mothers, and faith-filled forces were spiritual guides during their lifetimes and are still inspirations for us women today. Look towards these scripture verses and important figures next time you want to remind yourself of how much a woman can accomplish — especially with the power of her faith behind her.

                                                    Prayer: Lord, I dedicate this woman that comes seeking encouragement from you. That you may renew her strength and lead her in your paths of righteousness. Amen.

If we lead as examples of Jesus Christ and speak Scriptures of promise but also of warnings to our children, they will know the way to choose. Even when we fail to see God working in the lives of our children, we can have faith that his Word will not return void! Read these scriptures for kids with your family and be inspired by the Word of God.

                                                    God commands us to love others. One of the most simple ways to love is by helping when we see someone in need. Whether it is our time, money, or energy, giving to help someone in need is a mark of a mature Christian. We also find that helping others is a blessing to ourselves. Plus, you never know when you will be the one in need. Scripture tells us that we reap what we sow and that there are blessings for those who seek a life of serving loving others.

                                                    The lesson of having open hands and sharing with others is not just a lesson for kids! As adults, God calls us to share with those in need and to live a generous life. Sharing does not only bless those we give to but it blesses us as well! You will never know a full and joyful life until you are able to give out of generosity and shares what God has given you.
